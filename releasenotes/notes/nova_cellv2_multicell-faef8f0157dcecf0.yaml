    cell via oooq. If additional_cell is set to true after the
    overcloud got deployed the additional cell gets deployed. Todo
    this information gets extracted from the overcloud stack, which
    is requried as input to the second heat stack, where the additional
    cell is managed with. As a reference [1] is the scenario which
